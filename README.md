I created a snake game using Python's Pygame Module using traditional snake game rules.

Added features such as 
  - New Snake Color every round
  - Highscore Tracker displayed onto screen
  - Score Tracker displayed onto screen
  - Music
  - Death Screen
  - Ability to use either WASD or arrow keys to move the snake
  - Sound effects whenever the snake eats something or dies
